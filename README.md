# KruFPS

## Notice: While KruFPS works well, it does have many bugs. I would suggest trying out MOP - https://github.com/Athlon007/MOP



A mod that drastically improves FPS in My Summer Car

On my PC

CPU - Ryzen 7 1800X
RAM - 16GB 2666Mhz

I get about 25 FPS in my game once the satsuma is built.

With this mod, I get into the 50's, and once the Satsuma bug is fixed and it can be disabled, touching the 90's.

All without (as far as I yet know) detremental effects to the game.

That being said, I haven't yet done extensive testing, so PLEASE feel free to open bugs and help me fix them!
